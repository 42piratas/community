# Pull Requests, Code Reviews, and Merging

#### General guidelines
- Review code you are familiar with or have been actively working on recently.
- When, and only when, you are ready to beging a review of a PR, make sure no-one else is the `Asignee`, assign the PR to yourself. We will use the `Asignee` field seperately from the `Reviewers` field.  The person opening the PR may request many `Reviewers`, but we should only have one `Assignee` at at ime
- You should only be the `Asignee` of one PR at a time, so we can move things forward as quickly as possible.
- The presence of an `Asignee` means the code is being actively reviewed, and other's should avoid reviewing or merging.
- Merging of PRs is always a priority, it will assist in less conflicts, rebasing, and get other dependencies unblocked faster.
