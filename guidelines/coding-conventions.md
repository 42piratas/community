# Style Guide and Coding Conventions

## Purpose

This document contains conventions that help keep code consistent

This document defines MARKET Protocol coding standards for source code in
various languages, particularly JavaScript programming language.

The conventions include not only aesthetics such as formatting but also coding
standards.

## Code Style Guides and Tools

To avoid reinventing the wheel, MARKET Protocol builds on some well defined
and accepted standards.

### ECMA Script

For JavaScript, Google's ECMAScript 6th (or newer) style guide is our baseline.
ESLint can be used to programmatically validate code.
