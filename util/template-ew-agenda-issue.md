## Agenda

### Introductions
   * We'd like to take a few minutes and introduce people on the call.
   
### Contributors
   * This is an opportunity for us to talk about the community's involvement in MARKET Protocol.

### Notable Commits
   * Every week, we want to shout out to those in our community who continue to make this project great!

### Heads Up!
   * We break stuff and you need to know about it! And, it's an opportunity for us to share those, "watch out for..." It would be great to hear from the community on any "lessons learned" as you've been working with the MARKET Protocol project.

### Releases
   * What went out the door this week.

### CTO Round Table
   * This is an opportunity to ask Phil Elsasser, MARKET Protocol CTO, anything about the project. We'll also have some prepared topics a few times a month to share with the community. If there is anything you would like to hear about, please let us know.

### Demos
   * It's great to show working code and functionality. We'll pick one or two features completed in the past week and do a demo of the functionality.

### Discussion Topics
   * What's on your mind? Please share with us so we can have a structured discussion around a subject area.

### Next week
   * We'll discuss what we're focusing on next week and how you can help.
   
### Feedback
This agenda is always evolving and we'd like to get your feedback on how to make the Engineering calls better. What do you like, what should we get rid of, and what should we change??
